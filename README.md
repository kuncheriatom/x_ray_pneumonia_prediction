# X-ray Pneumonia Prediction

This project is a Streamlit application for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using different machine learning models, including a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.

## Features

- **Model Selection:** Users can choose from different models to make predictions.
- **Image Upload:** Upload chest X-ray images in JPEG format.
- **Prediction Output:** The application classifies the X-ray image as either "Normal" or "Pneumonia."

## Models Used

- **CNN Model:** A deep learning model trained on X-ray images.
- **ANN Model:** An Artificial Neural Network model.
- **Logistic Regression:** A classic machine learning model for binary classification.
- **Decision Tree:** A simple yet effective machine learning model.
